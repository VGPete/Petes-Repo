        <h4>What I learned</h4>
        <p>I spent most of the time this week working on the challenge project. I've got a good start going for the project with my basic interface completed and a basic call to the API to yeild some data. My next steps are to get the API calls working for various different views and searches but i'm also thinking I need to build out my storage system for local storage sooner than later so that I dont design around simply displaying a result when its also going to need to be saved. I'm glad that i've gotten a good headstart though. The biggest learning this week was me gettting back into CSS and how to use it to design the layout of the page. I spent lots of time learning to understand how to make divs show where I want them on the screen and how to adjust everything so that its working as expected.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Form Validation</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client side form validation allows users to fix issues before they get to the server, for security and to avoid incorrect data or delays.</li>
                    <li>Validation done in the browser is called client side validation, but if done in the server its server side validation.</li>
                    <li>The two types of validation are 1. Built-in & 2. Custom JavaScript </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Built-in:</b> Includes options to validate forms such as Required, minlength/maxlength, min/max for numerical values, type (email, number, etc), and pattern which allows for custom regex. </li>
                        <li><b>JavaScript</b> Allows for the constraint validation API which makes it very easy to validate forms. You can however still do completely custom validation without the API.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            <li><b>Fetch API</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The fetch API allows easy access to requests from server side content.</li>
                    <li>It returns a promise which if everything goes smoothly will provide the content requested.</li>
                    <li>The init object allows you to manipulate many settings of the fetch request including cors info, content type, credentials, method etc.</li> 
                    <li>Fetch can be used to do many things like access data on a server, upload data or files to a server. </li>
                    <li>Fetch has a catch feature for errors</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h4>Hang Ups</h4>
        <p>At this point my only hang ups would be if I dont set aside enough time to complete what is needed in the week.</p>
