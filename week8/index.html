        <h4>What I learned</h4>
        <p>This week I learned that assessing a sites needs before hand can save time and effort with design. Our team worked on the API project and decided that we only needed to display the information so we opted to focus on gathering and displaying instead of housing the info and building out classes or complex objects. I learned a lot from my team this week when it came to organizing the CSS in another file if a feature is very complex. This way the basic CSS is still easy to access and read. I learned that using await was a very easy way to handle async. I spent time on the buttons for our page and getting them to work properly was interesting since it helped me to realize how useful telemetry is for things like what the current page is. these things have to be implemented and are not immediately available. </p>

        <h4>Hang Ups</h4>
        <p>This week has been really tough for me. I have a large kideny stone moving since Saturday so im dealing with being on pain meds which make reading and working on this very difficult. Not only am I constantly nauseous but im also drowsy and had a difficult time focusing and staying awake. I did my best to read the text book chapters this week but I may have to go back and review them once im back to normal. I do feel very accomplished with what I got done considering the circumstances.</p>
