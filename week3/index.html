        <h4>What I learned</h4>
        <p>This week was a bit hectic for me. We had planned our team meeting and I ended up missing it because we were at the hospital having our new baby. I ended up going through everything my team had done to check for understanding and ask any questions to them as needed. So I missed the meeting but I did work parts of it out solo, and try to understand everything that was done. Hopefully that was enough. I also got caught up on all the Quiz Ninja code excercises and added them to my site. Functions and objects are something ive been familiar with so it felt like review although I think I may still be a bit rusty with them. The DOM is the part that I really had to study to understand. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>DOM is extremely useful for selecting or updating the page on a node level.</li>
            <li>The different array methods like pop, shift, push, are very useful for managing arrays without needing extra loops in the code.</li>
            <li>checks like some, every, & find can help locate information needed within arrays easily.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My main hangup this week was not being there for the team meeting and discussion. I feel that I would have really benefited from being there but unfortunately timing didnt work out with the new baby arriving. Now that I have some time off work i should be much more flexible to be there for the meetings.</p>
