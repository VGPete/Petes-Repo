        <h4>What I learned</h4>
        <p>Going through the reading this week I found that there have been a lot of updates to JavaScript in the last few years. People dont use var as much any more and instead use const and let, for example. This is strange to me but im excited to take in the new things. I also learned from my group meeting about arrow functions which I hadnt been exposed to before. I also learned from my group meeting that changing innerHTML is a great way to have dynamic output to the screen when using JavaScript functions. One of my group members introduced us to Live Share extention for VSCode which was really cool. It allowed all of us to add lines simultaniously so that we weren't limited to only one person driving. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>When deleting an item from an array, the position still exists and is undefined</li>
            <li>maps have been added to JavaScript</li>
            <li>Arrow functions have been added to JavaScript and they seem to be a great addition.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Hang ups this week: We were scrambling to get connected as a group for our group meeting. I realized I didnt yet have Visual Studio code, discord, or zoom on my PC. luckily I was able to get them setup during our group meeting without much issue and our group was able to meet and successfully complete the assignment.</p>
