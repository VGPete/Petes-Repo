        <h4>What I learned</h4>
        <p>I spent time updating the quiz ninja project and added the updates for chapter 8 - chapter 12. This quiz is a lot of fun and once i got things working with the buttons its a much better game than it was before. My team met today and we worked on the Tic Tac Toe game which turned out really well. We added features to show whos turn it is and if someone won or it was a tie. My group has a lot of very knowledgable people and they really help me better understand the usage of the things we have been learning. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using data- we were able to set each div to a position for tic tac toe</li>
            <li>We created an array of possible combinations and then used the some & every method to check for a winner in tic tac toe</li>
            <li>The random function can be quite useful</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My biggest hangup this week was that my group seem to be ahead of me in understanding so as i followed along I had to keep asking questions to understand what was being done. I am learning a lot from my team though.</p>
