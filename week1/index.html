        <h4>What I learned</h4>
        <p>This week was wake up call. I had to go back and look to see how long it had been since i took CS 213 and its been 4 years. I have done next to nothing with what I learned since then. I feel like i'm teaching myself againg from scratch. Luckily the concepts stuck and I just have to look up the syntax. </p>
        <p>I learned a lot this week. I never knew you could host your own page on github which is cool. I learned that you can test your page in the browser in real time without waiting for it to load. Using inspect and watching the console helped me to fix a lot of my issues. One of the biggest issues I had was sitting down for 5 hours and trying to power through the main portfolio page in one sitting. I got very frustrated near the end and finally went to bed, this morning I was able to get things running in no time. I learned that I need to plan for breaks to keep myself sane. I remember how much I enjoy working on web pages and seeing the changes and fixes that I make. Its a gratifying feeling to be able to show someone what I did. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>I learned that JQuery source needs to be before my JS source that depends on it</li>
            <li>I learned about onload and that I can use it to run my JS without having to click a button</li>
            <li>I learned that you can do just about anything with CSS if you know the right way to do it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Some of my hang-ups this week were that I failed to source my JS file so nothing worked. I also did way too many commits to my repo before realizing I should only commit working html/js and not use it as a way to test it. hopefully things will stay more clean for me going forward. I could not get a link to work when i used it as the text to appendChild on the LI. This is what I spent the most time on since It would display the link HTML as text but would not show the hyperlink. I finally found another way to do this with JQuery but I spent too much time trying to get it to work the other way. </p>
        <h4>Questions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Why does a string of HTML for a link used on the text node not show as a link after I use the appendChild feature?</li>
        </ol>
