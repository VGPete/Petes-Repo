        <h4>What I learned</h4>
        <p>This week I was all focused on getting the ToDo list project completed. It was tough since i'm still getting back into the swing of things after a 4 year break but I was able to figure it out. I learned a lot about the DOM and being able to select different elements and change their properties.</p>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating DOM elements and manipulating them like creating buttons and appending them to other elements.</li>
            <li>I learned about event listeners and how they work. I needed event listeners to get the buttons to work correctly.</li>
            <li>I spent some time with basic CSS and reminding myself how its done. I found that its better to group by class and not use multiple of the same id.</li>
            <li>I practiced looking at someone else's code and understanding all the moving parts. I was able to determine which functions were needed and how I should update them to fit my additions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Hang ups this week were there but most of them were simply due to me forgetting some of the basics and having to research and remind myself how to do things. I did get caught on how to tally the total tasks that were still active and it took me a while to figure out how to pass the info back and forth.</p>
        <h4>Questions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>No questions this week.</li>
        </ol>
