        <h4>What I learned</h4>
        <p>This week I learned a lot about the robust function abilities that JavaScript has. There are a lot of QoL features that other languages dont have. I especially liked the video the book suggested where it taught us about the stack and queue in browsers where I learned to better understand how to use JavaScript to do Asyncronous computing. I got the Quiz Ninja working where its fetching from the server and has a much larger list of heroes to cycle through. The team project was also very interesting as I learned to work with a team on an existing project. I realized that object oriented programming might be more of my strong suit than others on my team. Although im slow, I think I better understand the purposes of why classes are set up the way that they are, private vs public, and getters and setters. I still learn a lot from each of them when it comes to HTML and CSS though and shorthand JavaScript as well. </p>

        <h4>Hang Ups</h4>
        <p>One of the hangups I got stuck on was when I tried to do the Quiz Ninja exercise and the online link to the list of superheros was broken. It took me a while to figure out what my issue was since the provided link in the textbook didnt work and I thought it was an issue with CORS until I tried to go to the site and found it didnt exist. I was able to find an alternative link to use eventually though. The other hang up I had was realizing I had a different vision then the rest of my team for the team project this week. The issue im realizing is that I tend to lean toward object oriented programing using classes and objects to accomplish tasks but my other team members seem to be more focusesed on CSS & HTML so they tend to use JavaScript to essentially build the HTML. I dont know that its wrong but its just different so I struggled to stay on the same page as them and I dont know that im 100% satisfied with the end product of our project. I think I just need to better communicate to get past this.</p>
