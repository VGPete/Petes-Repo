        <h4>What I learned</h4>
        <p>I read through the reading which really helped as we did the sound parts of the team project this week. I also updated the Quiz Ninja project to have the high score which saves to local storage. The drum kit activity was really fun and I learned a lot from my team mates as we worked on it together. I also spent some time working on the block 2 challenge project and getting ready for it. I have an idea that i think will work and I hope I could get it made over the next few weeks (more details below). </p>

        <h4>Hang Ups</h4>
        <p>I wasnt able to make any progress early this week until I had the procedure to blast my kidney stone. That took away some of the time to work on the assignments this week. One of the issues I ran into was that our group project background image was not working once I added it to my site. I kept getting a 403 forbidden error even though its the same URL that you can search and see the image. I finally resorted to saving a copy to my site itself so that it will load properly. The "modern front end development workflow" part of the reading this week didnt go well for me. I understand what it was trying to have me do but after installing Node and using the start command it did build the directory but had some errors and i couldnt get the local host to show the site properly.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Purpose: </b>I think id like to build a basic app that lets you keep track of video games  in a list (possibly a list of games to play and games beaten). It will pull info on the games from a API called RAWG which has 500,000+ games with their details.</li>
            <li><b>Audience: </b>this would be for anyone who has interest in videogames and wants to browse them and make lists. I.E. list of games beat this year, list of games i want, list of games i still need to play.</li>
            <li><b>Data Sources: </b>I found a public API called <a href="https://rawg.io/apidocs#why-rawg-api">RAWG games database</a> . I think i will also use local storage to save the lists between sessions. </li>
